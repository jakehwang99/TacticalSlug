    <h1 class="content_header">Financial Agreements</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Your child's tuition is monthly. Scheduled holidays/teacher in-service days have already been considered in this rate and therefore no adjustments will be made in months containing closures. Payment is due and payable on the first day for the current month and is considered past due on the fifth, at which time a $35.00 late charge will be assessed to the account. If payment is
still not made by the 15th of the month, childcare will be discontinued until payment is made in full. Please place your child's full name on all checks. </p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Tuition Increases</h1>
    <p class="content_text">It may be necessary to increase tuition to maintain ideal standards and quality service. Parents/guardians will be notified in writing of any tuition increases at least 30 days in advance if such increases be necessary. </p>
