    <h1 class="content_header">Parent Bulletin Board</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Parent boards are located near the office. The board is the most important means of communication between the School and parents. They are used to display pertinent articles, contagious illness alerts, and vital daily information. Please make a point of checking the board each day. </p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Parent/Teacher Conferences</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Parent/Teacher Conferences are scheduled in November and February, so that all parents have an opportunity to review their childâ€™s progress report for the year to date and discuss other areas as needed. Parents are encouraged to contact the teacher for additional conferences as necessary. Most teachers will offer the best way to contact them during school hours. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">Good communication between parent and teacher is very important and in the best interest of the student. </p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Withdrawal</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Parents may withdraw a child from the program at any time. A THIRTY DAY WRITTEN NOTICE IS REQUIRED. Forms may be found in the back of the sign in books or in the school office. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">Parents wishing to withdraw their child, but who fail to provide a thirty day notice will still be liable for the last month of tuition. This policy applies to any program JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten has in place including summer placement. </p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Termination of Services</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Services may be immediately terminated for reasons which shall include (but not be limited to) the following: </p>
    <p class="content_text list">1. Any account delinquent for more than 15 days.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">2. Three incidents of late tuition payment.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">3. If the parent or guardian, refuses to sign forms required for the entrance or the continued enrollment of the child.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">4. Refusal by the parent, guardian, or emergency designee to pick up a child deemed unable or unwilling to participate cooperatively in classroom activities; due to illness, possible impending illness, lethargy, or uncontrollable harmful and/or disruptive behavior. (It is JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten's desire to provide all children the most ideal, safe, and effectual learning environment possible. Parents will be notified if their child is not well enough to participate in classroom activities or otherwise requires the undivided and individual attention of the teacher.) Parents of children enrolled at JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten understand that under such circumstances they must be available and willing to pick up their child or authorize their designated emergency persons to do so. In the event the emergency persons listed are unable to make pick up arrangements promptly, (no longer than 45 minutes) it becomes the sole responsibility of the parents or guardians to do so. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">5. When a child is causing harm to himself or others due to dangerous or unsafe behavior. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">6. In the event JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten is unable to meet the needs of the child and/or parents.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">7. Failure to provide JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten with current work and home telephone numbers and to report any such future changes which would enable school to contact parents in the event of emergency or illness in the most expeditious manner. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">8. Late arrivals are charged one dollar and fifty cents per minute. If parents fail to notify the school of their delay and an emergency pick up person cannot be contacted by 6:45 p.m. (as authorized in your child's emergency records) the Children's Shelter will be notified for the further protection and safe care of your child. The Children's Shelter telephone number is (408) 299-2535. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">9. Disregard for California State mandatory sign-in and out procedures.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">10. Behavior of the parent/guardian, which may be reasonably interpreted as harassment, verbal abuse, or physical abuse toward JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten staff or others present at JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">11. Refusal to comply with the policy and procedure outlined in the JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten handbook.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">12. Parents are required to escort their child directly into the classroom and make certain the teacher has acknowledged their arrival.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">13. Unescorted arrivals and/or lack of parental supervision of children prior to classroom admittance and upon their departure from the premises of JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten, are cause for immediate termination of services.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">14. Refusal to permit your child to attend chapel, participate in religious activities, or to recite Bible verses and worship songs.</p>
