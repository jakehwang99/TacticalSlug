    <h1 class="content_header">Field Trips</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Field trips and nature walks are considered an important part of the educational program and will be taken periodically to nearby places. The school will provide the same adequate, responsible, adult supervision for these excursions as is provided for the children while in attendance at the school. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">Notification is provided by volunteers who must submit a clear DMV record, proof of insurance, and a copy of a CA state driver's license. Volunteers will drive their own private vehicles if the field trip involves transportation of JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten's children. When such an event occurs, a notice will be posted on the classroom door stating where the class is going and approximate time of return. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">Your permission for your child to participate in such excursions is part of the "Acknowledgement for Receipt of Handbook" form. </p>
