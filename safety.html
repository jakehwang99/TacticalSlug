    <h1 class="content_header">Biting</h1>
    <p class="content_text">Jenny Lee Christian Preschool recognizes that biting is a normal developmental stage for under two year olds. However, we also know how upsetting it is to parents. Though it is normal for the early stage of child development, after reaching the preschool age or two years or older, most children do not continue biting. Biting is part of sensory motor exploration. There are many other things that can cause children to want to bite. Teething, peer interaction, frustration in expressing his/her needs and wants, and anxiety. </p>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p class="content_text">The Biting Plan of Action will be put into place for the welfare and safety of all children involved with our preschool programs:</p>
    <p class="content_text list">1. A verbal/written communication will be established daily between the teacher and the parents discussing the child in question.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">2. The director/teacher will meet with the parent to discuss the school plan for the child. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">3. If the child has attempted to bite three times within one day, we will be calling the parent to come and pick up their child for the remainder of the day. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">4. When a child bites two times in one week. The child will be sent home for the remainder of the day and the following day. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">5. If a child is sent home twice during the same week, either for attempted biting or actual biting, the child will be put on a probationary period for two weeks. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">6. If the attempts and/or biting problems are not resolvable within a two-week period, termination of service may result. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">JENNYLEE Christian Preschool reserves the right to review each case individually to determine if termination is eminent.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Disaster Preparation</h1>
    <p class="content_text">In the event of a disaster, we want to be optimally prepared. All students are required to have a three day emergency earthquake kit.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Discipline Policy</h1>
    <p class="content_text list">Discipline is one of the most challenging and important aspects of any child care program. While striving to provide children with the most stimulating and ideal learning environment, the staff at JENNYLEE Christian Preschool seeks to establish boundaries that are clear and guidelines which are consistent. Children in the preschool years are developing their ability to express emotions, needs, and desires in ways that are appropriate and meaningful.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">Consequently, teachers will assist children in the mastery of the skill through supervision, intervention, redirection, praise, and proper modeling. Children are also afforded choices whenever possible to reduce their feelings of powerlessness, and increase their sense of autonomy and cooperation. The staff further encourages children to verbalize anger and/or frustration in a manner which will produce positive and motivating results.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">However, if a child’s behavior is destructive or uncontrollable over an extended period of time, a conference date will be scheduled with the parents, and a variety of mutual expectations will be explored. As we work together to direct the children in positive ways, we are fulfilling our goal of instilling in each their own value, they learn to value and respect other individuals. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">All staff is forbidden from using any corporal punishment, which is defined as the use of negative physical touching.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Emergency Procedure</h1>
    <p class="content_text">In the event of a catastrophe, JENNYLEE Christian Preschool has implemented a procedure to ensure the safety and general well-being of the children within our school. In the unlikely event that children are relocated to an emergency shelter, a letter will be posted on the front entrance door of JENNYLEE Preschool and Kindergarten. </p>
    <p class="content_text list">Refer to this handbook for phone numbers you may call to receive information about your child. The director and staff will attempt to notify all parents with pertinent information.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Health Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="content_text">As mandated in state regulations, the teachers at JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten will conduct an informal health check on each child arriving at the school. Teachers also complete daily health forms for each child, which benefit us in determining chronic illness and aid us in our ability to communicate such information to patents.</p>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p class="content_text">For the protection of your child as well as other children in attendance, he/she must be kept home if he/she shows any of the following symptoms (Childcare Center General Licensing Requirements 101226): </p>
    <p class="content_text list">1. Fever with behavior change or other sign of illness, temperatures of 100 degree or greater.<br/>2. Vomiting one or more times in a 24 hour period of time.<br/>3. Uncontrollable diarrhea (2 times in a day).<br/>4.  Uncontrollable coughing or wheezing.<br>5. A rash. <br/>6. Addition symptoms indicating illness.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">Please note that we cannot accept your child at the school if they show these symptoms.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Medical Emergencies</h1>
    <p class="content_text">In the event of a medical emergency or of an accident, parents will be notified immediately. Should emergency treatment be required, the child will be taken to the medical facility closest to the school, or the facility deemed most appropriate by emergency medics.</p>
    <h1 class="content_header">Medication</h1>
    <p class="content_text list">If your child is to receive prescription medication during his stay at the school, you must fill out a “Permission to Administer Medication” form which is located in the school office. You will need to fill out the form completely and submit it along with the medication (in the original container) to your child’s teacher on a daily basis.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">We suggest that when filling prescriptions, you ask your pharmacist for two prescription bottles, one for home and one for school. Epi pens must have a prescription label on the pen itself.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">We regret that we are unable to administer any medication that is not prescribed by a physician. Medicines will be administered by a designated staff person.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">All medication will be stored in a location not accessible to children.</p>
    <p class="content_text list">Children receiving antibiotics at the school must have had such medication for a period of 36-48 hours prior to re-admission.</p>
