    <p class="content_text">Dear Parents, <br/><br/>First of all, thank you for the opportunity to allow our team to serve your family. Our team's main goal is to provide the best childcare with the same passion we have serving God. We want to explicitly state that our core foundation is God's love and is what we always have in mind when educating your child. We hope to encompass this love by expressing our love and support both mentally and physically as your child grows. <br/><br/>In His Services, <br/><br/>Jenny Lee<br/>JENNYLEE CHRISTIAN PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN Director
    <h1 class="content_header">Program Philosophy</h1>
    <p class="content_text">It is our team's belief that children are a very valuable gift from God that are meant to be treasured and nurtured according to the principles set forth in God's Word. We believe that children learn through experience and exploration. We also believe that children learn best through play, and we hope to create a fun and well-rounded environment that encourages healthy growth and development. Our goal is reflected in Matthew 13, the Parable of the Sower, where our focus is to have each child grow with God's heart, so in anything they learn or do they produce good fruits that yield a hundred times what was sown. This is achieved through providing practice in the areas of cognitive, perceptual, social, emotional, physical, creative and spiritual development as the key factors to the curriculum we have established at JENNYLEE Christian Preschool and Kindergarten. Our staff is committed to offering the highest standard in meeting these critical developmental needs. </p>
    <h1 class="content_header">What We Do</h1>
    <p class="content_text">In keeping with the philosophy of our program, we have structured an education that includes a love for learning, a love for the world around them, and an awareness of their importance to God. It is our goal to develop in each child a love for God and their surroundings.</p>
